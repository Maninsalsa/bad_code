# Exercise 1: String Rotation and Comparison

def is_rotation(string1, string2):
    # Pseudo code:
    # 1. Check if lengths are equal
    # 2. Concatenate string1 with itself
    # 3. Check if string2 is a substring of the concatenated string
    pass

# Exercise 2: List Index Manipulation

def manipulate_list(lst):
    # Pseudo code:
    # 1. Create a new list
    # 2. Iterate over the list with index
    # 3. Double elements at even indices, halve at odd indices
    pass

# Exercise 3: Nested Loop and Conditional Logic

def sum_greater_than(matrix, threshold):
    # Pseudo code:
    # 1. Initialize sum
    # 2. Use nested loops to iterate over matrix
    # 3. Add to sum if element is greater than threshold
    pass

# Exercise 4: Efficient Collection Combination

def combine_lists(list1, list2):
    # Pseudo code:
    # 1. Determine the longer list
    # 2. Iterate over indices
    # 3. Create tuples, filling with None if index is out of range
    pass

Below is a *module-by-module* roadmap that both follows the curriculum outline and includes *hands-on mini‑projects* at each step. The roadmap concludes with a *capstone project* that integrates everything learned. This plan is designed to build mastery through repeated practice, incremental challenges, and real‑world project experience.

# **How to Use This Plan**
- Move **sequentially** through the modules; each mini-project builds on the previous skills.
- Keep each mini-project in its own GitHub repository with a clear README.
- For each project, set clear, measurable goals (e.g., “I will complete the CRUD API for the library project by Wednesday”).
- Continually **refactor** and **improve** your code—mastery comes from *iterative refinement* as much as from new skills.
- Treat the **capstone project** as your magnum opus: it should demonstrate the complete stack of technologies, best practices, and personal flair.

By progressing through these mini-projects and culminating in a comprehensive capstone, you’ll achieve deep expertise in modern full-stack development—and graduate with a strong portfolio to show for it. Good luck!

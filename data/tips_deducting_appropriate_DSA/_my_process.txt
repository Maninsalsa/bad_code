Below is a process by which I approach coding. 

1. Question and Clarify the Requirements
	1.	Understand before You Code
	•	Rigorously analyze requirements before writing any code. Speak with the requirement
        source (stakeholders, product owner, documentation) to confirm you fully understand
        intent and constraints.
	•	Reorganize the requirements in your own words, making sure you truly capture what     
        is being asked.

	2.	Dig into Documentation
	•	Search all available documentation—API references, design specs, past modules—and 
        internalize how the system works.
	•	Make sure there are no hidden or conflicting assumptions before you begin coding.

	3.	Transform Requirements into Tests
	•	The most effective way to confirm you “got it right” is by writing tests based on 
        the requirements before coding any solution (Test-Driven Development, or TDD).
	•	This approach preemptively reduces wasted effort on misunderstood requirements or 
        missed edge cases. Tests act as both the blueprint and the safeguard.

Why This Matters:
Spending time clarifying requirements may seem lengthy, but it eliminates back-and-forth 
later. The up-front effort is exponential time savings compared to trying to fix incorrect 
assumptions halfway through development.

2. Code, Then Delete, Then Code Again
	1.	Iterative Creation and Destruction
	•	Write a first version that meets the test criteria.
	•	Save it, then delete the code, and rewrite it from scratch. Compare the two versions
         and note the differences.
	2.	Purpose of This Approach
	•	The goal is consistency: Can you arrive at the same working logic twice?
	•	Over multiple iterations, you naturally remove unnecessary steps or patterns. 
        Each fresh start clarifies the essential logic and helps you avoid bloat.
	3.	No Optimization Yet
	•	During these iterations, focus on correctness, clarity, and matching the tests.
	•	Optimization can wait until after you’re certain you have the right behavior and 
        a clear, minimal solution.

Why This Matters:
This approach sounds painstaking, but it cultivates deep understanding of your solution. 
By forcing yourself to rebuild, you sharpen your ability to spot redundancies and simplify
your code over time.

3. Optimize
	1.	Check for Efficiency
	•	With a stable, minimal solution in place, begin addressing time complexity, memory 
        usage, and potential scalability concerns.
	•	Use profiling or benchmarking tools to locate bottlenecks.
	2.	Optimization Techniques
	•	Data Structures & Algorithms: Evaluate whether your current approach uses the most 
        efficient data structures (e.g., arrays vs. linked lists, sets vs. maps) and algorithms.
	•	Refactor for Performance: Look for repeated or expensive operations that can be 
        streamlined or cached.
	•	Leverage Existing Libraries: Well-tested libraries are often optimized already; 
        don’t reinvent the wheel.
	3.	Iterative Tests
	•	Continue running your tests (and possibly create performance-specific tests). 
        Ensure you don’t break functionality while improving speed or memory usage.

Why This Matters:
Early optimization can lead to overengineering. By waiting until you have a correct solution, 
you can focus your efforts on improvements that genuinely matter to your application’s performance and scale.

4. Scale and Automate
	1.	Automate the Execution
	•	Once your solution is correct and optimized, look for ways to automate it—e.g., scheduling, 
        CI/CD pipelines, or triggers that run the code under specific conditions.
	•	This reduces manual intervention and frees the developer from operational overhead.
	2.	Consider Deployment and Integration
	•	If your solution will operate within a larger ecosystem (e.g., microservices architecture), 
        ensure it’s easy to integrate.
	•	Containerizing (Docker) or using serverless approaches can simplify deployment and scaling.
	3.	Documentation and Maintenance
	•	Finalize your README or user guide so others can quickly understand how and when the 
        code executes.
	•	Ensure your solution’s tests are part of an automated pipeline so any future changes 
        can be validated automatically.

Why This Matters:
A solution that works only on your machine or requires constant manual attention isn’t truly complete. 
Proper automation and integration let the system scale without demanding more of your time 
or risking operational mistakes.

Additional Considerations for Clean, Excellent Code
	1.	Code Reviews & Pair Programming
	•	Encourage peer review of your code for both logic and style. Fresh eyes often catch subtle 
        issues or suggest improvements.
	2.	Consistent Style & Linting
	•	Use a style guide, linter, or formatter (e.g., Prettier, ESLint for JavaScript; Black or 
        Flake8 for Python) to keep the code uniform and easier to read.
	3.	Version Control Best Practices
	•	Maintain clear git commit messages and well-defined branching strategies 
        (e.g., GitFlow, GitHub Flow).
	•	This history helps you revert or review code changes if problems arise.
	4.	Continuous Integration (CI)
	•	Integrate your tests into a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI)
        so each new commit or pull request triggers automated checks.
	5.	Security Considerations
	•	If your program deals with sensitive data, incorporate secure coding practices 
        (e.g., input validation, encryption where appropriate).
	•	Conduct threat modeling or security scans to ensure no vulnerabilities slip through.
	6.	Edge Cases and Negative Testing
	•	Test scenarios where inputs are invalid, zero-length, extremely large, or 
        otherwise unusual. This helps ensure robustness.

Final Thoughts

Your methodology already emphasizes testing first, iterative coding, and eventual 
optimization—all excellent pillars of modern software development. By adding elements like peer 
review, CI/CD, and security checks, you further elevate the quality and reliability of your code.

Remember: The overarching goal is clarity and correctness first, followed by performance and 
scalability. Ensuring that you continuously validate your logic through tests and iteration helps
deliver maintainable, high-quality software over time.

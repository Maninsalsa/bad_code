Project Prompt: Tax Calculator

Objective

Create a program that calculates the total tax amount based on a user’s income and their state’s tax rate. This will require:
	1.	Input: Ask the user for their annual income and their state (from a list of states).
	2.	Calculations: Based on the user’s state, apply the state’s specific income tax rate to calculate the tax.
	3.	Output: Display the user’s income, state, tax rate, and calculated tax.

Requirements

	•	The program should support tax rates for the following states:
	•	California: 13.3%
	•	Texas: 0% (no income tax)
	•	Florida: 0% (no income tax)
	•	New York: 8.82%
	•	Washington: 0% (no income tax)
	•	Allow the user to input their income in dollars (e.g., 55000).
	•	If the state has no income tax, display a message indicating that no tax is due.

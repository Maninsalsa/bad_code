Yes! There are a couple of relevant terms:

2. State Management & Event Protection:
   - Added "event isolation" to prevent unwanted triggers
   - Implemented "state guarding" via hasStarted flag
   - Added "resize debouncing" to prevent multiple resize events
   - Protected animation state from developer tools interaction

Key Terms:
- Event Isolation: Ensuring events only trigger under specific conditions
- State Guarding: Using flags (like hasStarted) to protect state changes
- Debouncing: Limiting how often an event can trigger (used in resize handler)
- Event Propagation Control: Controlling when and how events are handled
- singleton pattern
- flags

The most common technical terms for what we implemented are:
1. "Event Isolation" - Making sure events only happen when we want them to
2. "State Guarding" - Using flags to protect state changes
3. "Debouncing" - For the resize handler specifically

These are important patterns in web development for creating robust applications that maintain their state integrity regardless of user or developer interactions.

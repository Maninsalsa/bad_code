Here's a chronological list of challenges we encountered while building and deploying this Valentine's Day animation:

1. **Vercel Deployment Issues**
   - Initial CSS and JavaScript files not being found (404 errors)
   - File paths being interpreted incorrectly with `:1` suffix
   - Needed proper build configuration in `vercel.json`

2. **Audio Implementation**
   - MP3 file not loading (404 errors)
   - Required specific Content-Type headers for audio files
   - Needed proper file path with leading slash (`/TMWYHI.mp3`)

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Hearts too large for mobile screens
   - Font sizes not optimized for mobile
   - Text overflow issues in the card
   - Card crease line positioning needed adjustment
   - Layout spacing needed mobile-specific adjustments

4. **Touch Interaction Issues**
   - Play button not responding on mobile
   - Needed larger touch targets for mobile
   - Required specific touch event handling
   - Added touch-action and pointer-event properties
   - Implemented proper z-indexing for interactive elements

5. **CSS Layout Challenges**
   - Balancing heart sizes between desktop and mobile
   - Managing text layout in the card
   - Proper positioning of elements in different screen sizes
   - Maintaining animation quality while adjusting for mobile

6. **Debug Implementation**
   - Added console logging for troubleshooting
   - Implemented error handling for audio loading
   - Added event listeners for debugging touch interactions

7. **Performance Considerations**
   - Reduced petal count on mobile
   - Optimized animation handling
   - Managed resource loading and initialization

Each of these challenges required specific solutions and often multiple iterations to get 
right, especially for ensuring a consistent experience across both desktop and mobile devices.
